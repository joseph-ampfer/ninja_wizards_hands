Learn how to cast spells with hand gestures and defeat your opponent!

## What is Wizards Game?

A Unity-based 1v1 combat game where you use **hand gestures** to cast spells against an AI opponent.

- Cast spells using your webcam and hand gestures
- Strategic combat like a magical rock-paper-scissors
- No VR headset required!

## Getting Started

1. **Launch the game**
2. **Position yourself** in front of your webcam

**3 Simple Steps:**

1. **Perform the gesture sequence** with both hands
2. **Confirm the spell** by making two closed fists (✊✊)
3. **Watch your spell cast!**

Your current gesture combo appears in the **bottom left corner** of the screen.

## Spell Confirmation

After any gesture sequence, you MUST confirm to cast:
