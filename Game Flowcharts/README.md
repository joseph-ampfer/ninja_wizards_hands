*** We can implement these three options and be able to toggle between them in the Unity Editor


## 1. Auto-cast as soon as a valid spell is detected

* **Pros:**

  * Very fluid and fast — players can “discover” spells by accident.
  * Fits a “chaotic wizard duel” vibe.
* **Cons:**

  * Hard to cancel mistakes.
  * Limits more complex combos (you’d need to filter “partial matches”).
  * Doesn’t mesh well with unlock/paywall design (since players may fire unknown spells).

---

##  2. Manual Cast Trigger (hands off, double sign, or key press)

* **Examples:**

  * Hands leave screen → sequence is submitted.
  * Double “I Love You” 🤟 or double fist ✊✊ = “Cast now.”
  * Press spacebar = “Cast now.”

* **Pros:**

  * Gives players control, lets them cancel.
  * Allows **longer combos** (since recognition waits until explicit cast signal).
  * Fits RPG progression (you “know” which spell you’re trying to cast).

* **Cons:**

  * Slightly slower.
  * Needs clear tutorial/UI feedback (“Ready to cast! Do X to finish”).

##  3. Hybrid Approach

* Auto-cast *basic* spells (short combos like “Fireball”) → chaotic discovery.
* Require manual trigger for *advanced* spells (multi-step, or locked).
* This way, you get:

  * Accessibility for beginners.
  * Strategic depth for advanced play.

---

##  Game Design Implications

* **Discovery vs. Mastery**

  * Auto-cast favors discovery → “wow I found a new spell!”
  * Manual trigger favors mastery → “I practiced this combo and cast it intentionally.”

* **Progression Systems**

  * If spells are **unlockable (XP, paywall, etc.)**, then auto-cast must respect lock state → either block cast or give a “fizzle” effect if spell is locked.
  * Manual trigger makes it more natural — you only try what you’ve unlocked.
